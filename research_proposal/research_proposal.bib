ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Exhaustive methods of sequence alignment are accurate but slow, whereas heuristic approaches run quickly, but their complexity makes them more difficult to implement. We introduce bounded sparse dynamic programming (BSDP) to allow rapid approximation to exhaustive alignment. This is used within a framework whereby the alignment algorithms are described in terms of their underlying model, to allow automated development of efficient heuristic implementations which may be applied to a general set of sequence comparison problems.RESULTS:The speed and accuracy of this approach compares favourably with existing methods. Examples of its use in the context of genome annotation are given.CONCLUSIONS:This system allows rapid implementation of heuristics approximating to many complex alignment models, and has been incorporated into the freely available sequence alignment program, exonerate.},

title = {BatMis: A fast algorithm for k-mismatch mapping},
year = {2012}, 
doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/bts339}, 
abstract ={Motivation: Second Generation Sequencing (SGS) generates millions of reads that need to be aligned to a reference genome allowing errors. Although current aligners can efficiently map reads allowing a small number of mismatches, they are not well suited for handling a large number of mismatches. The efficiency of aligners can be improved using various heuristics, but the sensitivity and accuracy of the alignment is sacrificed. In this paper we introduce BatMis; an efficient method to align short reads to a reference allowing k mismatches. BatMis is a BWT based aligner that uses a seed and extend approach, and it is an exact method.Results: Benchmark tests show that BatMis performs better than competing aligners in solving the k-mismatch problem. Furthermore, it can compete favorably even when compared with the heuristic modes of the other aligners. BatMis is a useful alternative for applications where fast k-mismatch mappings, unique mappings or multiple mappings of SGS data are required.Availability and Implementation: BatMis is written in C/C++ and is freely available from http://code.google.com/p/batmis/Contact: ksung@comp.nus.edu.sgSupplementary Information: Supplementary information is available from Bioinformatics online.},
